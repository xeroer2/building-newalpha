*The early NewAlpha project taking shape in Godot.*

NewAlpha didn’t begin as a plan.

It began as a feeling I couldn’t quite shake.

For years I’ve missed a very specific era of the internet — a time when virtual spaces felt smaller, stranger, and more personal. When worlds weren’t products. They were places people built because they wanted somewhere to exist online.

ActiveWorlds was a big part of that feeling.

Not because it was technically impressive by modern standards, but because of what it represented. A persistent online space where building and exploring blurred together. A place that felt closer to a digital workshop than a game.

Over time, those kinds of spaces quietly disappeared.

Modern platforms became polished, monetised, and heavily structured. Incredible in many ways — but very different from the experimental, handmade worlds that first sparked my curiosity.

NewAlpha started as a simple thought:

“What if I just built my own?”

Not a clone. Not a remake.  
Just my own version of a persistent virtual space.

At first it was only an idea that came and went. Something to daydream about occasionally. But the idea kept returning. Gradually becoming less abstract and more practical.

Eventually curiosity won.

I installed Godot.  
Opened a new project.  
And placed the first cube into an empty scene.

That tiny moment quietly changed the idea from imaginary to inevitable.

Since then, NewAlpha has been taking shape in private. Systems forming, tools evolving, experiments stacking up — all slowly turning an idea into something tangible.

This dev log begins at the point where the project stops being a private experiment and becomes something I’m ready to document.

The early steps are always the most fragile.

Which makes them the most interesting to capture.
