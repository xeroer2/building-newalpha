There’s a particular feeling I’ve been chasing.

It’s the feeling of logging into an early 2000s virtual world.  
Standing on a simple street.  
Blocky buildings.  
Low resolution textures.  
A skybox that feels bigger than it should.

You’re not playing a game exactly.  
You’re just… there.

NewAlpha started as an attempt to recreate that feeling.

Not to rebuild the past, and not to clone anything that already exists — but to build my own version of that kind of space. A personal virtual universe. A digital workshop. A place where I can experiment, build, idle, and gradually expand something from nothing.

At its core, NewAlpha is:

- A sandbox  
- A social space (eventually)  
- A building platform  
- A long-term experiment  

Right now it’s simple. Cubes. Textures. A sky. A player controller.  
But simplicity is the point.

The goal isn’t to ship a game next month.

The goal is to build something that can grow over years.

## Why build this at all?

Because I don’t have a real workshop.

Because modern platforms feel closed.

Because I miss the era where worlds felt handmade.

Because I want a place where, if someone ever asks “Where do I find you?”, the answer could genuinely be:

“Go to my world.”

NewAlpha is that world.

## The philosophy

NewAlpha is not meant to be hyper-realistic.  
It doesn’t need AAA fidelity.  
It doesn’t need procedural planet generation.

It needs:

- Space  
- Creativity  
- Persistence  
- Identity  

It’s closer to a digital studio than a traditional game.

You don’t “win” NewAlpha.  
You inhabit it.

## Where it stands today

NewAlpha has already been quietly taking shape.

Systems are forming.  
Building tools are being tested.  
Textures are being replaced with original ones.  
Experiments are happening daily.

But this is the moment I’ve decided to start documenting it.

Not because it’s finished.  
Not because it’s polished.  
But because this is the stage where it still feels fragile and full of possibility.

Everything is raw.  
Everything is in motion.  
And that’s exactly when a project is most honest.

This dev log exists to capture that.

From the early experiments  
To whatever it eventually becomes.
