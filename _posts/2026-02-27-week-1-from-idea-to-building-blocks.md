This week marks the beginning of documenting NewAlpha publicly.

The project itself has been quietly taking shape, but this is the first time I’m intentionally capturing progress as it happens.

And the timing feels right — because NewAlpha is finally starting to look like a place instead of just a collection of experiments.

## Replacing Placeholder Assets

One of the first steps this week was replacing borrowed and temporary assets with original ones.

Textures may seem like a small detail, but they change how a world feels instantly. Even simple blocks and surfaces start giving the project its own identity once they’re created from scratch.

This week introduced the first original texture set:

- Grass (top)
- Grass (side)
- Dirt
- Prototype lab floor
- A simple sky texture

They’re intentionally simple. Clean. Tileable. Built for iteration.

This is the beginning of NewAlpha’s visual language.

## A Place to Stand

With original textures in place, the test world started to feel less like an empty editor scene and more like a space you can actually stand inside.

A prototype lab-style floor was also introduced. It isn’t meant to be a final environment — it’s a neutral building surface designed for experimentation and rapid iteration while core systems evolve.

There’s something fitting about building a world on top of a laboratory floor. NewAlpha right now is exactly that — a workshop.

## Building Tools Take Shape

This week also focused on interaction and early building tools.

Objects can now be placed, selected, duplicated, and deleted. A basic build panel exists. Selection gizmos are visible. Context interaction is forming.

These systems are still early and intentionally simple, but they represent an important shift:

NewAlpha is moving from scene editing toward world building.

## Looking Ahead

Right now NewAlpha is still small.

But the fundamentals are forming:

- A world to stand in  
- Original textures establishing identity  
- Tools to place and manipulate objects  
- A visible direction emerging  

That’s a strong start for Week 1.

Next steps will focus on expanding building tools, refining interaction, and continuing to replace temporary systems with intentional ones.

The world has officially begun.
